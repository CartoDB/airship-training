# Airship training

## TUTORIAL


1. Boilerplate

We're going to add three files:

- `index.html`: just a basic boilerplate where we'll add our page.
- `main.css`: the stylesheet where we'll add our custom CSS.
- `main.js`: the JS entry point to start adding our code.

2. Add Airship

Let's copy from `Usage from a CDN` from the guides.
http://airship-integration.developers.carto-staging.com/developers/airship/guides/getting-started/#usage-from-a-cdn

With the exception of JS, better at the bottom.

Let's copy a flag (styles + icon) and a switch to check that everything is being loaded.
